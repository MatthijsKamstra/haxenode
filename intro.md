# Haxe and Node.js

I wanted to do a quick prototype with Node.js and my favorite programming language Haxe.  
But I couldn't find any documentation on how to start.  
I knew there used to be a website (really old, when Haxe was spelled "haXe") that got you started.

But that is no more. So I decided to get some of that back.
Based upon the information from the old site and my own need to document this.

###How will this help me?

It will get you started with Node.js **and** Haxe.
How to setup your project, install externs and how to work with them. This probably will never be a complete documentation but it will help you get started!

###For who is this?

Probably for javascript developers who already started with Haxe and are curious about Node.js.


## Documentation goals

I wanted to make contributing to this documentation as easy as possible.  
That's why I use Markdown; developers use it, but is really just plane English so **everybody** can write documentation!  
And this documentation hosted on Github, developers favorite place to store code.  
Even if you are not a developer and/or don't want to clone everything, you still can modify the files on the website (you need account to login in and change the `.md` files).


## Open-sourcing the documentation

I thought I was the first to try to write documentation this way, but other beat me.  
Although my idea was formed by writing a book in Markdown (Gitbook, but there are others).
Writing documentation is very similar to writing a book.
