# Why use Haxe?

### You can create apps using a single unified programming language.

## Use existing Haxe &amp; JavaScript code
You can take advantage of the many other Haxe, JavaScript, and node.js libraries such as JQuery, express, &amp; mongo db. including many others from [Haxelib](href="http://lib.Haxe.org")

## JavaScript2 (ECMA4) features
JavaScript2 promised a lot of great features for the future. Haxe provides a very similar experience now &amp; is fully compatible with current browsers.

## Elegant Remoting between platforms
Pass objects between different platforms using remoting classes from the same codebase. Successful de-serialization makes remoting between platforms elegant and fast.

## Benefits type checking
Strict type checking &amp; compile-time checks allows you to catch errors before testing in the browser or vm. This means a faster work-flow for dynamically typed targets (like JavaScript).

## ECMA style programming
ECMA style programming for client-side, server-side &amp; desktop. The Haxe syntax is familiar to those coming from ActionScript and JavaScript.

## Extremely fast compiling
**It would be awesome to have proof!**
