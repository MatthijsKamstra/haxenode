# About haxenode (Haxe and Node.js)

JavaScript is **one** of the targets you can use when you work with [Haxe](http://haxe.org/).
And JavaScript is becoming one of the most powerful and [popular](https://github.com/blog/2047-language-trends-on-github) languages you can learn.

One of the reasons it's becoming so popular is Node.js!
With node you write JavaScript for the back-end.

With JavaScript and node.js you are able to write front-end AND back-end.



You would say the (Haxe) documentation about the JavaScript target would we **very** big.

**Well, you guessed it, it's not.**
The information scattered across the web on blogs, forums, tweets, etc.

I can bitch about it, or do something about it... I choose the second.

----

There used to be a website (an old one, from when Haxe spelled "haXe") that got you started.

But that is no more. So I decided to get some of that back.
Based upon the information from the old site and my own need to document this.

---

I started with the information from the old site. A simple copy, paste. Most of the content of this site/book is from different sources (with permission of the writers). Eventually (that means in the future) I will rewrite it (or not).

The rewrite will focus on getting the old information/tutorials updated to current use of Haxe and JavaScript.
*And more motivational gif :D !*
