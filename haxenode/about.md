# About haxenode (Haxe and Node.js)

Javascript is **one** of the targets you can use when you work with [Haxe](http://haxe.org/).
And javascript is becoming one of the most powerful and [popular](https://github.com/blog/2047-language-trends-on-github) language you can learn.

One of the reasons it's becoming so popular is Node.js!
With node you write javascript for the backend.

With javascript and node.js you are able to write front-end AND back-end.

So you would say the (Haxe) documentation about the javascript (node.js) target would we very big.

**Well, you guested it, it's not.**   
The information about Haxe and Javascript is scattered across the web on blogs, forums, tweets, etc.
The information about Haxe and Node.js is almost non existing...

I have started with documentation of [Haxe and javascript](http://matthijskamstra.github.io/haxejs/) and this document is for Haxe and Node.js.

----

There used to be a website (really old, when Haxe was spelled "haXe") that got you started.

But that is no more. So I decided to get some of that back.

---

I started with the information from the old site. A simple copy, paste. Most of the content of this site/book is from different sources (with permission of the writers). Eventually (that means in the future) I will rewrite it (or not).
 
The rewrite will focus on getting the old information/tutorials updated to current use of Haxe and Javascript.  
*And more motivational gif :D !*
