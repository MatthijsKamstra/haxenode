#Externs

Tell something more about the externs



### Haxe externs (NPM types for Haxe)

<https://github.com/clemos/haxe-js-kit>

```
haxelib git js-kit https://github.com/clemos/haxe-js-kit.git haxelib
```

[https://github.com/abedev/npm](https://github.com/abedev/npm)   

```
haxelib git npm https://github.com/abedev/npm
```

Documentation can be found [here](https://rawgit.com/abedev/npm/master/docs/index.html) 



### Honorable mention

I am not sure about how good these externs are. They have been converted from typescript to hx.

> DefinitelyTyped repository converted with ts2hx

But even they are not working a 100%, it's a really good place to start from.
And it's **a lot of externs**
