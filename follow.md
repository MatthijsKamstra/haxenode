#Who to follow

The Haxe community is a pleasant one.
So if you have questions, just got the [google haxe group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/haxelang/) and ask it.

You can also be non verbal and just follow Haxe people on Twitter for example
I have compiled a list of Haxe peeps with there speciality 


##Haxe in general

People how work on the Haxe compiler and thus are super smart!
Specially I want to point out Nicolas Cannasse who is the creator of Haxe but not the only one who works on Haxe.
