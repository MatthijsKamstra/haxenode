# About Node website

The cool part about *Node.js* that it's JavaScript for back-end!
You write JavaScript but for the back-end!
Did I mention back-end?

But the important thing to know is that everything in *Node.js* is clean/minimal.
You could rewrite every call, or use a framework that does all the heavy lifting.

If you started this tutorials/examples from the beginning you already seen [http in action](../00helloworld/about.md).
Which tells the http classes that express (also) uses, it's nice to know how things work.
But if you want to create a website I strongly suggest you use `ExpressJS`!!!

In this tutorial we will be using [Express](http://expressjs.com):

> ### Web Applications
> Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
> <http://expressjs.com>

And build an `index.html`, `remote.html` and `404`!

This example covers 3 different examples

- [Basic](exampleBasic.md)
- [Intermediate](exampleIntermediate.md)
- [Advanced](exampleAdvanced.md)



Because I don't want to spend time on styling the `.html`/`.jade` files, I use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples)
