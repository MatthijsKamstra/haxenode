# Choosing a Code Editor

Once Haxe has been installed, it is helpful to choose an integrated development environment (IDE) with good support for Haxe and OpenFL development.

Although you can write code using even a simple text editor, a quality IDE can provide code completion (code hints), shortcuts to build and test your projects, and other tools to give you a great coding experience.

## FlashDevelop

[FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org) is one of the strongest IDEs for Haxe development. If you are a Windows user (and perhaps if you are not), we recommend that you try FlashDevelop first to get a feel for what an integrated environment looks like. Many developers prefer FlashDevelop.

FlashDevelop is free and open-source.

## Sublime Text

[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) is a code editor, with support for Haxe using the [Haxe Sublime Bundle](https://github.com/clemos/haxe-sublime-bundle). Sublime Text is cross-platform, with support for Windows, Mac and Linux.

Unlike FlashDevelop, Sublime Text does not provide accurate code completion, nor does it support "projects" in the traditional IDE sense. However, Sublime Text is much stronger than a simple text editor, and is a good recommendation for Mac and Linux users.

Sublime Text is free-to-use, with reminders to pay for continued use.

## IntelliJ IDEA

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is primarily marketed as a Java IDE, but it has growing support within the Haxe community, including large teams, such as TiVo. The full edition, as well as the free community edition, support the [Haxe plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6873?pr=idea), which is not easy to install, but can provide a fuller native IDE experience for Mac or Linux users.

## Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io/) A hackable text editor
for the 21st Century.  
Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable to the coreâ€”a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively without ever touching a config file.

## Brackets

[Brackets](http://brackets.io/) is a lightweight, yet powerful, modern text editor. We blend visual tools into the editor so you get the right amount of help when you want it.



## Other Choices

There are other code editors to choose from, include vim and up-and-coming Haxe-based editors. You can read more at [http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/editors-and-ides.html](http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/editors-and-ides.html)

`*` there is a way to get it partially working on Mac, but I failed.  
`**` it will ask you to pay for a license
