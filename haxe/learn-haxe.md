## haxe.org

Can't miss this one, it's the mother ship

[haxe.org - documentation](http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/)


## Haxe API documentation

Documentation can be found here: [http://api.haxe.org/](http://api.haxe.org/)


## Haxe Manual

Same idea as this documentation (not with `.md`- but `.tex`-files), but more in-depth into coding with Haxe (wip): the [HaxeManual](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/HaxeManual)  
Download the [pdf here](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/HaxeManual/raw/master/HaxeManual/HaxeManual.pdf)


## Try Haxe

Not really a place to learn, but to try out without installing Haxe.
