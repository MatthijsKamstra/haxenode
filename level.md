#Level of Difficulty 

I thought it would be useful to have some idea what sort of level the examples have here.


How to define your level on a specific topic?

- **Beginner:** No knowledge at all of the topic
- **Basic:** A very basic knowledge of the topic but no professional usage
- **Intermediate:** A basic knowledge of the topic but no regular professional usage
- **Advanced:** A good knowledge of the topic and a regular professional usage
- **Expert:** A perfect knowledge of the topic and a daily professional usage


How does that translate to these examples?

##Beginner
**No knowledge at all of the topic.**  
These examples start with the simplest code. 
But I don't think you will have any use of these examples without knowledge of Haxe or JavaScript.
Start learning the basics of JavaScript and Haxe.
To get you start I have a little chapter about [learning Haxe](haxe/learn-haxe.md).


##Basic
**A very basic knowledge of the topic but no professional usage**  

* [Example Hello World](00helloworld/about.md)
* [Example writing](01writing/about.md)
* [Example Reading](02reading/about.md)

##Intermediate
**A basic knowledge of the topic but no regular professional usage**  

* [Example Lowdb](03lowdb/about.md)
* [Example HaxeLow](04haxelow/about.md)
* [Example Website](05website/about.md)
* [Example NeDB](06nedb/about.md)

##Advanced
**A good knowledge of the topic and a regular professional usage**  

* [Example Slack bot](09slackbot/about.md)
* [Example Scraping](10scraping/about.md)
* [Example Automation](11automation/about.md)


##Expert
**a perfect knowledge of the topic and a daily professional usage**  

Go away, you're done.
