#About Nedb

There is always a need to store data, one way or another.
We already describe two ways to store data in a `.json` file ([haxelow](../04haxelow) and [lowdb](../03lowdb)).

But what if we need something with more punch: [neddb](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb)

## NeDB (Node embedded database)

> Embedded persistent database for Node.js, written in Javascript, with no dependency (except npm modules), which can be used with a simple require statement. The API is a subset of MongoDB's. You can use it as a persistent or an in-memory only datastore, and it can also be used in all recent browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE9+).


```
npm install nedb --save 
```
