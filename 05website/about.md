#About Node website

The cool part about *Node.js* that it's javascript for backend!  
You write javascript but for the backend!  
Did I mention backend?

But the important thing to know is that everything in *Node.js* is very minimal.  
You could rewrite every call, or use a framework that does all the heavy lifting.

If you started this tutorials/examples from the beginnen you already seen [http in action](../00helloworld/about.md).

In this tutorial we will be using [Express](http://expressjs.com):

> ###Web Applications
> Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.  
> <http://expressjs.com>

And build an `index.html`, `remote.html` and `404`!
