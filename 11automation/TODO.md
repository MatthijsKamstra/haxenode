## Install the grunt plugin grunt-nodemon

> Grunt task to run nodemon

[grunt-nodemon](https://github.com/ChrisWren/grunt-nodemon)  
The sad thing is, that this project is not actively maintainded.  
So I hope someone will pick it up again...   
But for now it seems to work so enjoy!

```
npm install grunt-nodemon --save-dev
```
