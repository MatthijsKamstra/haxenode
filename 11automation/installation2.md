#Installation

Read the how to install **Node.js** and **Haxe** [here](../haxenode/download.md).

This example is not about Node.js per se, but we use an node example to explain the workings of automation.
And that's why we need to install js-kit.

Use haxelib to install **js-kit** :

> Currently this is done via git, but it will not change a lot, so you could ignore this message :D

```
haxelib git js-kit https://github.com/clemos/haxe-js-kit.git haxelib
```
