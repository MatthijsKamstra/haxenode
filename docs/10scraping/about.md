# About scraping

> Web scraping is the process of programmatically retrieving information from the Internet. As the volume of data on the web has increased, this practice has become increasingly widespread. And a number of powerful services have emerged to simplify it.


> Web scraping (web harvesting or web data extraction) is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites.

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)

Okay another explanation:
> Web Scraping refers to an application that processes the HTML of a Web page to extract data for manipulation such as converting the Web page to another format (i.e. HTML to WML). Web Scraping scripts and applications will simulate a person viewing a Web site with a browser. With these scripts you can connect to a Web page and request a page, as a browser would do. The Web server will send back the page which you can then manipulate or extract specific information from.
